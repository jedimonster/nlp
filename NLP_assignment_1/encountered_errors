1. Encoding problem
When searching for bear text in cz07 (new category "homeowrk") threw an encoding error:
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2014' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)

we should've used .tolower on everything, since without it the tagger misses stuff simply due to different case.
