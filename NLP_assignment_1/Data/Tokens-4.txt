NLTK
3.0
contains
a
number
of
interface
changes
.
These
are
being
incorporated
into
a
new
version
of
the
NLTK
book
updated
for
Python
3
and
NLTK
3
.
The
way
NLTK
works
with
unicode
is
changed
:
NLTK3
requires
all
text
input
to
be
unicode
and
always
return
text
as
unicode
.
Previously
some
functions
and
classes
worked
on
unicode
and
others
required
encoded
bytestrings
.
Please
make
sure
you
're
passing
unicode
to
NLTK
and
expecting
unicode
output
from
NLTK
-
existing
code
that
assumes
bytestrings
may
start
to
fail
.
