Testing
The CI test suite previously running at Shining Panda is down due to them having taken their Clap de Fin. There have been some investigations into moving to other CI, but no official build is running right now. This may change in the near future.
nltk/test/runtests.py is a good starting point for running tests locally, but note that the suite is currently failing.
